Because I was a recipient of the Presidential Science Scholarship when I was an undergraduate student, I felt uncomfortable that I was not receiving any scholarship, and my parents were paying my tuition. Being awarded the SNU Graduate Scholarship, now I can afford my tuition. It means a lot to me.
