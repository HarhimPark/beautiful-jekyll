We submitted a paper suggesting a new computation model for the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to the Journal of Mathematical Psychology. It is my first first-authored paper. We also uploaded it to PsyArXiv. Here is the link to the [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/sdzj4/). Thanks a lot for all the support and help.
