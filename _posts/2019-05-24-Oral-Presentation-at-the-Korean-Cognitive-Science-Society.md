It was the first time to present my work at a conference. 
The title of my presentation was 'Predicting trial-wise choices from multi-modal data'.
We tried to predict trial-wise choices in a new environment by combining computational models with eye movement data. The results were significant, but not better than I expected. I got some meaningful questions and feedback which may be helpful to improve my project. Communicating with other researchers at the conference was quite exciting.
